This application has 2 screens one of catalog and one of cart
This react native application is using Redux, Thunk & Typescript 

**NOTE** 
I have not implemented test cases as i was facing problems with enzyme and configuring it's dependency as in this project i am using React 18

To run this application

Clone this repository to your local machine.

After cloning this repository

Run 'yarn' on root folder which will install package.json dependencies

After that 

cd ios && pod install

This will add all necesssary pods required to run ios project.
For now i have only run this application on iOS

After pods are installed
